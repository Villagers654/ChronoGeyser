Thank you for considering a contribution! Generally, ChronoGeyser welcomes PRs from everyone. There are some guidelines about what features should go where:


*Pull requests that may not get accepted:* Niche features that apply to a specific group, for example, integration with a specific plugin. For now, please create a separate plugin if possible.

*Pull requests for ChronoGeyser:* Anything that improves the experience for bedrock players on versions *older* than the latest supported by Geyser. Anything else should be sent upstream to Geyser.

Geyser has some general style guides that should be applied throughout the code, which can be found in their [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

If you're making a pull request that also depends on changes to [the base API](https://github.com/GeyserMC/api), you must commit those changes to the Geyser API before making your pull request to ChronoGeyser.
